You can style your notes by adding `poem` to cssclasses.
You can use [Style Settings Plugins](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) to change the background colour and fonts. 

To add dividers to you poems, use this html tage: `<div class="divider">ðŸ™š</div>`

You can also center the text, and heading 1 using `center-text` and `center-heading`
